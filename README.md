Experimental 2D Bingo Wheel with Physics

Unfinished experiment to create a 2d Bingo Wheel in TypeScript/JavaScript. 

## Demo
Demo (also unfinished) for the wheel here: https://terrabythia.github.io/2d-bingo-wheel/demo/ 

## Credits
Uses the brilliant matter-js library for physics simulation: https://brm.io/matter-js 
Uses this free vector art for the different color balls: https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/91068-lotto-bingo-balls-vector-free

## TODO
- Implement (optional) multiple collision layers into wheel
- Add image of wheel on top of canvas (optional)
- Ground (if needed?): make responsive based on canvas width and height
